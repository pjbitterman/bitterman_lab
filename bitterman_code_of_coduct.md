## HESI Lab Code of Conduct

In the Human-Environment Systems, Interactions, Impacts, and Intelligence (HESI) Lab we work to create an inclusive and welcoming environment. We value the participation of every member of our lab, the University, and the broader community as a whole. We work to ensure that every lab member and collaborator has a positive educational experience unhindered by unnecessary challenges caused by non-inclusive behavior. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any Bitterman Lab activity is expected to demonstrate respect and courtesy to all other community members at all times.

Dr. Patrick Bitterman, as head of the HESI Lab, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment and discrimination-free experience for everyone. Discrimination or harassment based on racial or ethnic background, citizenship status, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, gender identity/expression, sexual orientation, dis/ability status, appearance or body size will not be tolerated. We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination by and/or of members of our community in any form. This is also in accordance with Kent State's Discrimination and Harassment Policy (https://www.kent.edu/policyreg/university-policy-regarding-unlawful-discrimination-and-harassment#:~:text=This%20policy%20prohibits%20discrimination%20and,complaint%20process%20is%20also%20prohibited.).

We do not tolerate harassment or discrimination of lab members in any form. We are particularly motivated to support new and/or anxious collaborators, people who are looking to learn and develop their skills, and anyone who may have experienced discrimination in the past.

### Expectations of the Bitterman Lab include:

- All communication - online and in person - should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate at any time.

- Be kind to others. Criticism is essential in science, but it must be constructive if we're going to move it forward in a supportive, inclusive way.

- Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate, but even more generally, treat others with respect. Give colleagues your attention and courtesy.

- Make an effort to make an inclusive environment for everyone. Give everyone a chance to talk and an opportunity to contribute. Don't dominate, talk over, or try to compete with your colleagues

- Utilize the correct pronouns for someone. If you do not know, simply ask. If you get it wrong, give a quick apology and get it right the next time.

- Watch out for microaggressions. Be aware that your actions can be hurtful to others or contribute to a negative environment even if you had no intent of harm. Listen. Offer a genuine apology. Commit to learning and doing better.
